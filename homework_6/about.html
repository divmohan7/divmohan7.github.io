      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Since 1987 the Bun Bun Bake Shop has been a fan favorite in the Pittsburgh area. We are devoted to providing you with fresh cinnamon buns that remind you of the warm feeling you get when watching a soldier come home to their dog, or a duck imprinting on a human.</p>
      <p> We are a small bakery specializing in cinnamon rolls, from our famous original cinnamon rolls to a variety of artisanal flavors. We ship fresh rolls anywhere in the Southwestern Pennsylvania. Visitors to our site should be able to buy cinnamon rolls by different flavors. We promise you'll be satisfied with each and every one.</p>
