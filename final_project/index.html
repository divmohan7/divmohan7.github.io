       On Christmas of 1990, Swiss researcher Tim Berners-Lee created the world’s first Web Browser. In 1994, the first web banned in the world was created in 476 x56px. This period of web design was characterised by the most basic uses of HTML, flat markup, and those infamous <a class="hyperlinks" href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-hyperlinks-are-blue/">blue hyperlinks.</a>

          <p>In 1995, David Bohnett and John Rezner founded the Beverly Hills web hosting company GeoCities, offering users 2MB of free disk space to host their website. This gave people opportunities to express their individuality. Everyone could code. A slew of creativity and the development of Flash led to neon colors, 3D buttons, splash pages, and spacer gifs. In the mid-1990s, less wasn’t more - more was more.This was an era of experimentation almost with the intention of being as illegible and eclectic as possible.</p>

    <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item"><p>The early 2000s brought increased support for CSS. There was a decrease (though not a full elimination) of the use of garish colors and an increased appreciation for white space. Not to say there wasn’t still an outlet for that late 90s creativity through fonts, 3D gradient buttons, and bright colors to distinguish headings. Links became attached to icons rather than hyperlink text. Usability became more of a focus.</p><img src="images/2000s-icons.png" alt="retro icons"><p class="caption">Icons made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com/" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a></p></div>

More attention was paid to color distribution, typography, and content over Flash animation. Buying and selling was a major focus of the web at this time and so tags, keyword optimization, and easy to use search functions became important for businesses and profit.</p></div>

    <h1>Today</h1>
    <p>The modern web is essential and irreplaceable. No more 3D buttons! Minimaism and blended typography as well as generous use of large, high resolution images, and infinite scrolling have taken the center stage. Here we see responsive web design as mobile devices and tablets become a frequent way of navigating the web. The way we think about the web is no longer hi-tech, it’s vital and therefore needs to be accessible, adaptable, and usable.</p>
